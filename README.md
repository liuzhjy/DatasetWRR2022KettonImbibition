# DatasetWRR2022KettonImbibition
Two-phase fluid distribution data for the imbibition in Ketton rock at different injection flow rates.

## Description
The forced imbibition in porous media under a fully wetting condition has complex interfacial dynamics due to the influence of additional meniscus such as corner flow. This project demonstrates the fluid distribution within the Ketton pore space at different injection flow rates obtained using direct pore-scale simulations. These data allow a visual examination of the differences in pore filling dynamics and displacement patterns at different injection flow rates.
